================================================================================
Overview:
This document defines optional expansion modules for TradeBot, fully compliant with core architecture {CURRENT_VERSION}. Modules are independently testable, maintain strict separation of concerns, and must be toggled exclusively via `.env_bot`.

Modules Included:

1. Backtesting and Strategy Optimization
- Backtesting framework in `tbot_bot/backtest/`
- Supports simulation of historical trade data, slippage, latency
- Must adhere to `.env_bot.test` config schema
- Produces JSON/CSV summaries for tuning, stored in `backtest_results/`
- Optimization supports grid, bayesian, genetic methods; results versioned in Web UI

2. Detailed Broker API Integration
- Includes advanced adapters for Alpaca, IBKR, Tradier
- Handles REST/WebSocket, order lifecycle, retry, error management
- Implements `.self_check()` with connection, credential validation
- Supports fallback routing and failover per `.env_bot` toggles
- Logs all API events for audit; rate limits strictly enforced

3. Encryption & Key Management Enhancements
- Key rotation tooling (`tools/rotate_keys.py`)
- Automated config encryption/decryption workflows (`tools/encrypt_env_bot.py`)
- Secure ephemeral key storage strategies for container/cloud deployments
- Audit trails for key usage and config changes

4. Reporting & Compliance Extensions
- Extended reporting API for tax, regulatory filings
- Custom OFX export formats
- Automated backup rotation and cloud sync scripts
- Fine-grained alerting and escalation policies

Implementation Notes:
- All optional modules must NOT interfere with core runtime if disabled.
- Modules must implement `.self_check()` to integrate with system health.
- Any config toggles required must be clearly documented in `.env_bot` schema.
- Use strict logging standards and audit trails.

Compliance:
- Modules adhere strictly to {CURRENT_VERSION} build instructions and audit requirements.
- No runtime config or credential leaks permitted.
- Must operate independently of Web UI unless explicitly integrated.
