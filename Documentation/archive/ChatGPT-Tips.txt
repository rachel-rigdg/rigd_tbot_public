What Triple Backticks Do:
Keep all spacing and line breaks intact

Prevent ChatGPT from auto-formatting quotes, dashes, or symbols

Make it easier to copy/paste directly into code editors or .env files

Use them especially when pasting:

Python scripts

YAML or JSON blocks

.env or .ini config files

Shell commands or CLI examples

Got it. Here's exactly what you would type or paste into the chat input field to preserve formatting using triple backticks.

Example: Exact Input You’d Type Into Chat
plaintext
Copy

Please analyze the following config block:

```
# .env_bot - Trading Bot Environment File

VERSION_TAG=v1.0.0
BUILD_MODE=release
TEST_MODE=true
DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL=verbose
ENABLE_LOGGING=true
LOG_FORMAT=json

TOTAL_ALLOCATION=0.02
MAX_TRADES=4
WEIGHTS=0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2
DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT=0.05
MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE=0.025
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=5

BROKER=alpaca
ALPACA_MODE=paper
IBKR_MODE=paper
STRATEGY_SEQUENCE=open,mid,close
STRATEGY_OVERRIDE=null
```



Breakdown:

Start and end the code block with triple backticks: ``` (no spaces before or after).

You can optionally add a language after the first triple backtick (like python, json, or env) to trigger syntax highlighting. Example: ```env.

Anything inside stays exactly as you typed it—ChatGPT won't reformat quotes, equal signs, or spacing.

Let me know if you want a template for a specific file (like main_bot.py or settings_bot.py)!
