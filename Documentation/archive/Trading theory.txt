Strategy_open logic: 
	•	Core Workflow:
	•	 bot triggers at 9:30 AM EST.
	•	20-minute analysis window collects real-time price/volume data.
	•	Bot identifies high/low breakout range and selects up to 4 top trade candidates.
	•	then Orders are only placed if price breaks above/below range + buffer.
	•	then Trailing stop-loss of 2% manages downside risk.
	•	Monitoring window is 30 minutes, with hard exit at the end of window. (Approx 10:20 am
	•	Allocation Logic:
	•	Dynamic position weighting based on how many trades pass the buffer, and in which order:
	•	1 trade → 100% of allocation
	•	2 trades → 60/40 split
	•	3 trades → 40/30/30
	•	4 trades → 40/20/20/20
