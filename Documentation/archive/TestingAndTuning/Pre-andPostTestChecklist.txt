==============================
PRE-TEST CHECKLIST (Before 1-Week Paper Run)
==============================
Goal: Ensure strategy + broker logic is working, and that all logs are valid and isolated for test

1. Strategy Execution
----------------------
[ ] STRAT_OPEN_ENABLED=true
[ ] STRAT_MID_ENABLED=true
[ ] STRAT_CLOSE_ENABLED=true
[ ] Each strategy runs at correct START_TIME_* in .env_bot
[ ] Confirm runtime self_check() passes for all strategies
[ ] TEST_MODE=true and FORCE_PAPER_EXPORT=false (unless otherwise needed)

2. Broker + Data Feed
----------------------
[ ] Alpaca or IBKR paper mode confirmed active (ALPACA_MODE/IBKR_MODE = paper)
[ ] Finnhub API is pulling fresh price/volume data
[ ] Each strategy is triggering real trade candidates (check logs)

3. Trade Logging + Export
----------------------
[ ] ENABLE_LOGGING=true and LOG_FORMAT=json or csv
[ ] Logging confirmed to:
    - open_paper.log, mid_paper.log, close_paper.log
    - trade_history_paper.json, trade_history_paper.csv
    - daily_summary_paper.json
[ ] No _live files touched
[ ] Manager.io export module writing simulated entries correctly (if in use)
[ ] GnuCash export (if still active) routing to gnu_paper.gnucash
[ ] Backups routing to /backups/ with timestamped files

4. System Watchdogs
----------------------
[ ] kill_switch.py and watchdog_bot.py are active and not erroring
[ ] risk_bot.py is enforcing all rules (allocations, stop loss, max trades, etc.)

5. Pre-Test Reset
----------------------
[ ] Clear /logs/bot/paper/
[ ] Clear trade_history_paper.*
[ ] Reset gnu_paper.gnucash or manager ledger (optional: archive previous)
[ ] Archive any previous test run data

==============================
POST-TEST ANALYSIS CHECKLIST (After 1-Week Paper Run)
==============================
Goal: Diagnose, improve, and refine strategy logic and tuning

1. Trade Results
----------------------
[ ] Count of total trades per strategy
[ ] Win rate per strategy (target â‰¥ 65%)
[ ] Average PnL per trade and per strategy
[ ] Worst-case and best-case trades (for edge case analysis)
[ ] Frequency of entry vs no entry (is strategy too passive?)

2. Timing Behavior
----------------------
[ ] Did each strategy start at correct time each day?
[ ] Any skipped days due to config or TRADING_DAYS logic?
[ ] Did trades exit at end of *_MONITORING_TIME?

3. Risk Enforcement
----------------------
[ ] Were stop-loss triggers hit correctly?
[ ] Any violations of DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT or MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE?
[ ] Did kill switch ever fire? Was it appropriate?

4. Broker Behavior
----------------------
[ ] Any rejections or order partials? (Check unresolved_orders_paper.log)
[ ] Any API timeouts or slow response issues? (Verify watchdog_bot)
[ ] Any trades skipped due to volume, spread, or other filters?

5. Export Quality
----------------------
[ ] trade_history_paper.json/csv is clean and complete
[ ] daily_summary_paper.json matches logs and counts
[ ] Manager.io or GnuCash ledger shows all entries cleanly
[ ] All backups present in /backups/ with correct timestamp
