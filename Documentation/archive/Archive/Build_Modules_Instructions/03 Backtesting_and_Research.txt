# INSTRUCTION SET: Backtesting & Research

This chat will focus **only** on Backtesting & Research.

Scope includes:
- tbot_bot/backtest/ engine and modules
- Historical data loading, simulation, performance metrics
- Plotting and result visualization

Build rules:
- Backtest runs isolated (no live ledger or broker impact)
- Runtime parameters sourced from .env_bot
- Outputs written only to backtest-specific files (trade_history_backtest.*)
- Results compatible with main strategy logic (same validation paths)

Chat behavior:
- One script or test module at a time
- User must confirm before proceeding
- Full file prints, no placeholders

Focus:
- Reproducible historical simulation
- Metrics aligned to live system performance
- Isolation from live/paper accounts
