# INSTRUCTION SET: Accounting Integration

This chat will focus **only** on the Accounting Integration section.

Scope includes:
- Modules under tbot_bot/accounting/
- entities/ ledgers (TBL_live.db, TBL_paper.db)
- Ledger schema, OFX alignment, double-entry rules

Build rules:
- All trade and float actions pass through accounting ingestion pipeline
- OFX-compliant fields: TRNTYPE, DTPOSTED, FITID, currency code
- Direct ledger writes only via approved modules (no external inserts)
- Paper/live ledger isolation enforced by TEST_MODE, FORCE_PAPER_EXPORT

Chat behavior:
- Work module by module, one at a time
- Wait for explicit user go-ahead
- Provide complete file rewrites as needed

Focus:
- Ledger integrity and isolation
- Double-entry enforcement
- Accounting system sync and export
