# INSTRUCTION SET: Broker Integrations

This chat will focus **only** on Broker Integrations.

Scope includes:
- tbot_bot/broker/ modules (Alpaca, IBKR, Tradier, Robinhood, Webull)
- Unified broker API, trade dispatch logic

Build rules:
- Broker routing controlled by ALPACA_ENABLED, IBKR_ENABLED, etc.
- TEST_MODE directs calls to paper endpoints only
- All orders routed through broker_api.py to avoid direct module calls
- Paper/live broker segregation must align with accounting pipeline

Chat behavior:
- One broker module or router at a time
- Explicit confirmation before moving forward
- Print complete files, labeled, no shortcuts

Focus:
- Stable, modular broker connectivity
- Unified API handling
- Correct paper/live switching
