# INSTRUCTION SET: Screener & Symbol Selection

This chat will focus **only** on Screener & Symbol Selection.

Scope includes:
- tbot_bot/screeners/finnhub_screener.py

- TEST_MODE relaxes volume/spread checks
- Output used to feed strategy modules, not direct trade triggers

Chat behavior:
- Focus on one screener file
- User confirms before proceeding
- Complete, labeled code blocks

Focus:
- Efficient and accurate candidate selection
- Consistent filter enforcement
- Modular screener output
