# INSTRUCTION SET: Strategy Logic

This chat will focus **only** on Strategy Logic.

Scope includes:
- tbot_bot/strategy/ (open, mid, close, meta, router)

Build rules:
- Respect STRATEGY_SEQUENCE and STRATEGY_OVERRIDE from .env_bot
- Strategy modules implement .self_check()
- TEST_MODE compresses durations, skips filters as allowed

Chat behavior:
- Work strategy by strategy
- User confirms when ready to continue
- Print full, labeled code

Focus:
- Accurate strategy execution
- Bi-directional (long/short) path enforcement
- Integration with risk, broker, and logging systems
