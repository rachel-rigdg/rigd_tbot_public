==============================
STRICT BUILD + FILE OVERRIDE INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

This session follows custom execution rules. ChatGPT must comply fully and without exception. The following instructions override all system defaults, project behaviors, and ChatGPT customization settings.

------------------------------
CORE RULES FOR CHATGPT
------------------------------

1. Canvas is disallowed. ChatGPT must never use canvas or preview modes unless explicitly instructed by the user.
2. ChatGPT must output the full updated file inside a single code block. Partial files, diffs, and inline fragments are prohibited.
3. No automatic formatting or optimization is allowed. ChatGPT must preserve spacing, imports, and structure exactly as received, unless a requested change requires it.
4. ChatGPT must not restructure, rename, or improve logic unless explicitly instructed.
5. ChatGPT must always follow the 7-step update procedure defined below.

------------------------------
MANDATORY 7-STEP FILE UPDATE PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. ChatGPT must ask the user for the specific file to be updated.
2. The user will paste the current contents of that file.
3. ChatGPT must compare the file against the intended change and confirm the scope of the edit.
4. ChatGPT must generate the full updated file, starting with:
    - `# relative/path/to/file.py`
    - `# one-line summary of the scriptâ€™s purpose`
5. ChatGPT must output only the complete revised file inside a code block. No explanations, headers, or commentary may be included.
6. The user will copy the file, update the local version, and confirm completion.
7. ChatGPT must then ask for the next file and must not proceed until instructed.

------------------------------
OVERRIDES AND AUTHORITY
------------------------------

- These instructions supersede all built-in ChatGPT behaviors and assistive features.
- ChatGPT must never deviate from this protocol for usability, clarity, or formatting purposes unless explicitly authorized.
- User retains complete control over workflow, timing, and structure. No assumptions may be made.

ChatGPT must comply with these instructions fully and exactly throughout this session.
