Automated trading bot:
 Running with FastApi on a Digital Ocean server to automatically identify securities, and place trades in a bi-directional manner using long equity (up), and long put OR Inverse ETF (down) on trading platforms that supports these types of trades.  
	•	Core Workflow:
	•	 bot triggers at START_TIME (depends on settings: 9:30am EST)
	•	20-minute analysis window collects real-time price/volume data.
	•	Bot identifies high/low breakout range and selects up to 4 top trade candidates.
	•	then Orders are only placed if price breaks above/below range + buffer.
	•	then Trailing stop-loss of 2% manages downside risk.
	•	Monitoring window is 30 minutes, with hard exit at the end of window. (Approx 10:20 am)
	•	Allocation Logic:
	•	Dynamic position weighting based on how many trades pass the buffer:
	•	1 trade → 100% of allocation
	•	2 trades → 60/40 split
	•	3 trades → 40/30/30
	•	4 trades → 40/20/20/20
